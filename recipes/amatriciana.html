      <li>100g guanciale, diced</li>
      <li>400g canned tomatoes</li>
      <li>50g Pecorino cheese, grated</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a pan, cook the guanciale over medium heat until it becomes crispy.
        Remove from the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add the chopped onion and chili pepper (if using) and
        sauté until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the canned tomatoes to the pan, breaking them up with a spoon.
        Simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the sauce thickens. Season with
        salt and black pepper to taste.
      </li>
