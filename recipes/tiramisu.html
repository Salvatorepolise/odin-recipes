    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>300g ladyfingers (savoiardi)</li>
      <li>500g mascarpone cheese</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
      <li>200ml strong brewed coffee, cooled</li>
      <li>2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
      <li>Cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mascarpone cheese to the egg yolk mixture and mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently
        fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the brewed coffee and coffee liqueur (if using) in a shallow
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are
        soaked but not soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish.
      </li>
      <li>> Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining
        mascarpone mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the
        flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder.</li>
    </ol>
